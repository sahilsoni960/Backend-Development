## ðŸ“‚ Featured Project: SmartPersonalKB-GenAI
**SmartPersonalKB-GenAI** is an AI-powered personal knowledge base application designed to help you store, organize, and query notes, code snippets, and documents. It features:
- **Generative AI Integration:** Uses Google Gemini for Q&A and summarization.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extensible for new data types and LLMs.
- **Local-First:** Runs with an embedded H2 database for easy setup.
- **RESTful API:** CRUD operations for notes, snippets, and documents.
- **RAG:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

Find it in the [`SmartPersonalKB-GenAI`](./SmartPersonalKB-GenAI/) directory.

## ðŸ“‚ Featured Project: Market Digest AI

**Market Digest AI** is a web dashboard for monitoring global company news and trends. Users can search, filter, and select companies, then view the latest news and trending information, all in one place. The dashboard fetches real-time news using NewsAPI.org and leverages the Gemini LLM API to generate summaries, extract key points, and provide sentiment/context analysis for each company's news.

- **Fullstack Solution:** Java Spring Boot backend (REST API) and React frontend (Material UI).
- **Real-Time News:** Fetches and displays the latest news for selected companies.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Uses Gemini LLM for news summarization, key point extraction, and sentiment analysis.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, card-based, dark-themed dashboard with multi-company selection and comparison.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clean API boundaries and robust error handling.

Find it in the [`Market Digest AI`](./Market%20Digest%20AI/) directory.
